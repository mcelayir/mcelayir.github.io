To be able to deliver the functionality, a server needs to be spinned up and accept connections which requires resources like CPU and RAM should be allocated. In addition to that you have to make sure that your server is running 24/7 to handle the requests and also you have to make sure that the server is behind firewalls with latest security patches applied and only the allowed ones are accessing it. 

Moreover, to you have ensure that the server scales up or down depending on the load. You would like your application to be able to handle the load and serve every user even if the traffic on your application increases enormously. On the other hand you wouldn't want your application to consume resources even if there is no traffic at all. Dedicating resources to a contantly running insance can come up with huge bills from the cloud provider.

To summarize, developing, deploying and maintaining these applications comes up with other challenges which often prevents developers to focus on their job and deliver or improve a functionality.

Keeping all above in mind, serverless is a
