# What is flutter

Flutter is a free and open-source mobile application development SDK for building high-performance, native-looking apps for IOS and Android sharing the same codebase. Flutter aims to make development process easier, quick and more productive.

# What makes flutter cool

Flutter does not use Javascript but uses Dart, a simple object-oriented programming language. Since it is compiled into binary code, Dart can run like a native app and communicate with the platform without using a Javascript bridge. That's why it is more performant then other cross platform development SDKs.

Flutter doesn't use native UI components. Instead Flutter, has its own UI components (they are called <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets">widgets</a>) and an engine to render them on both Android and IOS platforms.

Also I would like to mention that Flutter has `Hot Reload` feature which allows developers to change the code and reload as the application runs.

Lastly, Flutter is a very useful tool for prototyping and creating mockups as it is very easy to design and create good looking UIs with Flutter.

# Installing flutter

To install flutter on your machine, simply check suitable <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install">installation guide</a> for your platform.

Flutter SDK can also be installed using official Intellij plugin.

# Installing Intellij plugin

To install the Intellij plugin for Flutter. Go to <i>Preferences > Plugins</i>, select <i>Browse Repositories</i> and search for <i>Flutter</i>.

# Creating a new project

Now, with the Flutter pluggin installed, a template project can easily 
be created by selecting Flutter under <i> New Project</i>.

Also Flutter SDK can be downloaded from this menu.

# App overview

In this tutorial, we are going to build a simple JSON/XML reader application. 

First the app will read categories and sources (like BBC News or Goal.com) associated with those categories and display them for user to select.

Sources 1             |  Sources 2
