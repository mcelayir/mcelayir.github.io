# What is flutter

Flutter is a free and open-source mobile application development SDK for building high-performance, native-looking apps for IOS and Android sharing the same codebase.

# What makes flutter cool

Flutter does not use Javascript but uses Dart, a simple object-oriented programming language. Since it is compiled into binary code, Dart can run like a native app and communicate with the platform without using a Javascript bridge. That's why it is more performant then other cross platform development SDKs.

Flutter doesn't use native UI components. Instead Flutter, has its own UI components (they are called <a href="https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/widgets">widgets</a>) and an engine to render them on both Android and IOS platforms.

Also I would like to mention that Flutter hos `Hot Reload` feature which allows developers to change the code and reload as the application runs.
